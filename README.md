this is something i made that transcribes audio into text, however it searchs for topics or subjects in that audio and presents it to you in a neet ui.
. so for example, if you talked about cars,trees,ocean.
and the topics or subejcet is metal. 

youll see it in the gui. it will tell you why it thinks X subject or topic was mentioned in said audio you loaded in. you can record live from your mic or upload an audio file.

the only thing you need is gradio. gradio is what is used to create the ui.
within the code you will need to replace yout own Openai (API) key. other then that your good to test it out.
